# CodeWars
This repository contains all my solved CodeWars problems since 07.07.2023    
My goal is to atleast solve one kata a day    
Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata    
Number of solved kata so far: 11   
Most consecutive days are 10 from 07.07.2023 until "end of streak not reached yet"
